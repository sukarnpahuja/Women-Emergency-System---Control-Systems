Women is the inside society part and her security is the essential and to a great
degree critical for the strong society, in the present years we are seeing the
various women incitements reports, shockingly women being centered around

After the NIRBHAYA case in Delhi, various real changes are recognized by the
Indian vote based framework and besides various real walks have taken to
ensure the women prosperity.
India which searches for itself as a promising super power and a money related
focus can fulfill its target if and just if a far reaching amount of women get
themselves included and appreciate the change strategy. The main objective of
this project is to design an IOT Product which belongs to wearable devices. This
device consists of the sensor layer which is able to measure the biological
parameters of the women at tensed situation and triggers the messages to care
takers. She can secure herself in the emergency condition by enumerating about
the administrators or nearest police base camp by means of actually initiating
messages. We are using Arduino Uno, HC05 Bluetooth Module, Trigger
Switch, Pulse Rate Sensor, Piezoelectric Sensor, and an Infrared Sensor.
